# Controllers

tl;dr these classes are deprecated, do not user

I don't think we actually need these classes. A controller is any class that
handle's user input and then orchestrates interactions between other layers
of our application. I think that means that the UI classes that contain
the buttons that control each of these functions are the actual Controller classes.
