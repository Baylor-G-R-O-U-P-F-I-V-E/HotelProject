# DAO

From Wikipedia

"In software, a **data access object (DAO)** is a pattern that provides an
abstract interfact to some type of database or persistence mechanism.
By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, the DAO procides data
operations without exposing database details. This isolation supports the
*Single Responsibility Principle*. It separates the data access the application
needs, in terms of domain-specific objects and data types (the DAOs public
interface), from how these needs can be satisfied with a specific DBMS (the
implementation of the DAO)"
